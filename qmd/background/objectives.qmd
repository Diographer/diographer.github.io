## Objectives

### General Objectives

This research aims to delineate the influence of adaptive resilience as a
buffer of general health stressors in eliciting depression, anxiety, and
burnout.

<!-- Comment:

The general objectives of this research is as a proof of concept regarding the
use of a general modelling framework using an agent-based model approach. The
general modelling framework will take any input in a form of a graph object,
which is rather flexible and extensible. Though the current analytic and
simulation capacity is rather narrow, but it shall highlight the importance of
model parameters in a dynamic system, represented as an evolving simulation.

### Specific Objectives

This research poses five specific objectives, each is focused as a separate
investigation:

1. Systematically find the required modelling parameter through a scoping
   review
1. Evaluate the seasonality of psychopharmaca uses
1. Extract the temporal health parameter by examining the annual mental health
   profiles
1. Measure the cost effectiveness of policy interventions affecting individual
   resilience
1. Evaluate the output parameters through a large-scale survey
