The data collected through a large-scale survey are as follow:
- Screening: https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20Screener.pdf
- Depression: https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20Depression.pdf
- Anxiety: https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20GAD.pdf

A large-scale survey will be conducted online following the convenience sampling procedure. Convenience sampling, a part of non-probability sampling, is favored due to its simplicity and applicability. Although convenience sampling does not directly support generalizability to the general population, it is possible to match respondents' demography, which will allow generalizing specific sub-populations to a certain degree. On the other hand, using a probability sampling method is naturally desirable; however, without an institutionally accessible internet panel for research purposes in Indonesia, probability sampling is impractical. By adopting convenience sampling, we can establish a pseudo-panel comprised of multiple groups of heterogeneous sub-populations. A list of pseudo-panelists is selected through clustered random sampling by adjusting representativeness using the demography data. The disadvantage of this approach is the inability to pre-allocate respondents into clusters, which is only made possible during interim analysis after data collection.
