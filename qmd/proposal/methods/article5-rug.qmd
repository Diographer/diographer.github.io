## Article 5: Survey on Mental Resilience, Burnout, and Depression \label{survey} {#sec-survey}

This survey is a follow up of previous surveys in Indonesia, including @elvira2021psychological and @lamuri2023burnout. In this survey, we will employ a Maslach's Burnout Inventory [MBI, @Maslach1986] to measure burnout; Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to measure depression; and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to measure anxiety; alongside collecting sociodemographic data and exposure to stressors as suggested in @sec-stressor.

### Practical Interpretation {-}

The results from this survey imply the state of being resilient as a moderator of stressor and psychological disorders. Conducting the survey will allow us to propose a streamlined and generalisable approach to measure the effectiveness of suggested policy.
