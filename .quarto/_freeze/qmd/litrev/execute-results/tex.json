As a state, resilience is best defined as a\ndynamic adaptive behaviour that emerges due to circumstantial changes. Several\nconstituents of resilience as a trait includes habitual effective coping\nmechanism and positive emotions, both act as a buffer against negative life\nevents [@davydov2010resilience]. Meanwhile, as a state, resilience is a dynamic\ncapacity to adapt supported by the interaction of internal and external\nfactors, including biological, psychological, social, and ecological systems\n[@ungar2020resilience]. Resilience as a trait is observable as a non-adaptive\ncountermeasures, where the individual will act against the stressful events,\ni.e. being resistant to adversities. On the other hand, resilience as state is\nan adaptive transformation to prevent persistent dysfunction or\npsychopathology [@davydov2010resilience], thus, will be better suited for any\nmodelling and policy-directed research.\n\nThe intertwining facade of the trait and state of resilience is explainable as\nan inherent activities of neurocircuitries [@rutten2013resilience], where\ngene-environmental interactions play a role in determining individual\nsusceptibility to psychiatric illness (resilience as a trait)\n[@amstadter2014psychiatric]. Also, there exists biological mechanism that allow\nexperience-dependant plasticity and fuel up adaptability (resilience as a\nstate) [@derakhshan2020attentional; @rutten2013resilience]. By considering both\nsides of resilience, This research is concerned with the latter aspect, where\nmaintaining an adaptive behavior is of essence to abate the development of\nmental disorder.\n\n## Stressors Precipitating the Development of Mental Issues \\label{stressor} {#sec-stressor}\n\nResilience is the moderator between risk factors and psychological disorders,\ntherefore, a clear definition of included stressors will aid in developing an\nexplainable and generalizable study design [@ungar2020resilience]. Defining the\nstressors also allow us to measure resilience using a reactivity approach,\nwhere resilience is evaluated as growing tolerance to regular stress\n[@davydov2010resilience]. This way we can partly assess the dynamic process in\ndeveloping an adaptive behavior.\n\nThe presence of stressors disrupts physiological function to a lower utility\nstate [@oken2015systems]. Following the methods proposed by @veer2021psycho,\nour research evaluates two distinct groups of stressor, namely the general\ndaily stressor and health-related stressor. The general stressor is an\ninstrument comprising ten items of daily hassles and life events, while the\nhealth-related stressor consists of items reflecting adversity related to\ngeneral health concern in self, families, and close relatives. Any item rated\nas `\"TRUE\"` is then weighted for the severity, ranging from *not burdensome* (0) to\n*substantially burdensome* (5). Below is the excerpt of the general stressor\nitems:\n\n- Negative political events\n- Conflicts with relatives or colleagues\n- Financial problems\n- Physical health problems\n- Mental health problems\n- Burdensome experiences with family\n- Burdensome experiences in workplace\n- Conflicts with strangers\n- Separation from a loved one, which triggers reduced social contact and\n  loneliness\n- Death of a loved one\n\nThe health-related stressor in @veer2021psycho was particularly narrating\ndistress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In brief, these items are comprised\nof trepidation or perceived burden due to a disease, thus adaptable for a more\ngeneral research context.\n\n## Psychological Outcomes \\label{psych} {#sec-psych}\n\nDepression, anxiety, and burnout are selected as outcomes of interest due to\nthe relatedness between burnout $\\rightleftharpoons$ depression and burnout\n$\\rightleftharpoons$ anxiety [@koutsimani2019relationship]. The partial\ncorrelations have a moderate effect size, signifying the boundary between\nburnout and depression also burnout and anxiety. Therefore, statistically,\neach of depression, anxiety, and burnout does not share similar latent\nconstruct even though they have closely-related manifests. This is\ninterpretable as distinctive remarks to differentiate three of such outcomes\nand the clinical importance of examining the others when one is present.\n\nBurnout is a condition of increasing depersonalization and emotional\nexhaustion, leading to reduced personal accomplishment in the workplace (sense\nof inefficacy). Burnout often happens due to a long-term ongoing stressor,\nwhere the inability to cope with external issues decreases work engagement\n[@Schaufeli2017]. The incidence of burnout overlaps with psychological\ndistress, marked by depressive symptoms or anxiety.\n\nIn a recent finding, burnout is partially explainable by depression and\nanxiety. Depression symptoms pose similar characteristics to exhaustion and\ndepersonalization, while anxiety is related to the sense of personal inefficacy\n[@golonka2019occupational]. In theory, depression is marked by the loss of\nenergy (fatigue) and anxiety is marked by being excessively worried; but a\nstudy suggested the presence of anxious depression [@gaspersz2018patients],\nwhich in turn also implies a pathophysiological overlap between depression and\nanxiety.  Moreover, lower brain connectivity in the default mode network is a\ncurious co-occurrence between depression [@jacob2020neural], anxiety\n[@imperatori2019default], and burnout [@shang2022aberrant]. Neurobiological,\nclinical, and contextual overlaps between depression, anxiety, and burnout\nnecessitate the inclusion of these outcomes to infer a more general impact of\nassociated stressors.\n\nSeveral policies have been implemented to alleviate the mental health burden in\nIndonesia, mainly highlighted in the Mental Health Act in 2014\n[@tampubolon2021covid], and further defined in the Indonesian Minister of\nHealth Regulation Number 77 of 2015 and Indonesian Minister of Health\nRegulation Number 54 of 2017 [@hartono2018tracking]. During the pandemic, the\ngovernment of Indonesia has stipulated a Presidential Decree R1 No. 7 of 2020\nto promptly respond the pandemic; however, the practical implementation has not\naddressed mental health issues. Though, several ongoing initiatives led by the\ngovernment has been realized as a regulation on managing a digital counselling\nplatform [@tampubolon2021covid]. The digital platform, conducted through\nvarious chat-based and video call-based application, helps the general\npopulation to get in touch with therapists, psychologists, counselors, and\neducational practitioners [@ifdil2020online]. Tele-consulting, either through\nchat or video call, enables practitioners to provide psychological first aid to\naddress elevated distress during the pandemic, depression, and anxiety\n[@ifdil2020online].\n\n# Conceptual Framework and Research Hypothesis\n\n## Conceptual Framework \\label{concept} {#sec-concept}\n\n@fig-concept explains the conceptual framework of the proposed\ninvestigation. An individual perceives stressors, moderated by an adaptive\nresilience, resulting in a varying degree of psychological outcomes. Any\nmedication taken during the course of observable diagnosis is presumed to\naffect the mental health, which in return influence the resilience. The\ntheoretical remarks of resilience is further investigated in a scoping review\n(denoted by `#1` in the conceptual framework figure), conducted following the methods\nin [-@sec-scoping.rev]. The trend of medication uses (`#2`) is\ninvestigated following the methods in [-@sec-med].  Psychological\noutcomes (`#3`) are investigated following the methods in\n[-@sec-psych.method]. The methods measuring impacts of medication uses to mental\nresilience (`#4`) is described in section [-@sec-cost]. Lastly, the methods\ndelineating the overall theoretical remarks (`#5`) is defined in section\n[-@sec-survey].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Conceptual framework of how stressors are moderated by mental resilience in affecting the psychological outcome](../fig/conceptual-framework.png){#fig-concept width=\\textwidth}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Research Hypothesis\n\nThe proposed research encompasses five main topics of interest, and the\nhypotheses are ordered accordingly.
