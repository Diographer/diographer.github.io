{"title":"LITERATURE REVIEW","markdown":{"headingText":"LITERATURE REVIEW","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis chapter shall focus on elaborating theories and findings pertaining to resilience and psychological outcomes. @sec-resilience explains the scope and context of mental resilience in this research. @sec-stressor defines a set of stressors investigated in this research, which will be the generic precipitator of maladaptive behavior. @sec-psych justifies the psychological outcomes. @sec-concept illustrates the conceptual framework of the current proposal.\n\n## Resilience as an Indicator of Mental Immunity \\label{resilience} {#sec-resilience}\n\nResilience can be seen as a trait or a state of a human psyche, where\nresilience as a trait covers contributing internal factors that help the\nindividual to overcome adversities. As a state, resilience is best defined as a\ndynamic adaptive behaviour that emerges due to circumstantial changes. Several\nconstituents of resilience as a trait includes habitual effective coping\nmechanism and positive emotions, both act as a buffer against negative life\nevents [@davydov2010resilience]. Meanwhile, as a state, resilience is a dynamic\ncapacity to adapt supported by the interaction of internal and external\nfactors, including biological, psychological, social, and ecological systems\n[@ungar2020resilience]. Resilience as a trait is observable as a non-adaptive\ncountermeasures, where the individual will act against the stressful events,\ni.e. being resistant to adversities. On the other hand, resilience as state is\nan adaptive transformation to prevent persistent dysfunction or\npsychopathology [@davydov2010resilience], thus, will be better suited for any\nmodelling and policy-directed research.\n\nThe intertwining facade of the trait and state of resilience is explainable as\nan inherent activities of neurocircuitries [@rutten2013resilience], where\ngene-environmental interactions play a role in determining individual\nsusceptibility to psychiatric illness (resilience as a trait)\n[@amstadter2014psychiatric]. Also, there exists biological mechanism that allow\nexperience-dependant plasticity and fuel up adaptability (resilience as a\nstate) [@derakhshan2020attentional; @rutten2013resilience]. By considering both\nsides of resilience, This research is concerned with the latter aspect, where\nmaintaining an adaptive behavior is of essence to abate the development of\nmental disorder.\n\n## Stressors Precipitating the Development of Mental Issues \\label{stressor} {#sec-stressor}\n\nResilience is the moderator between risk factors and psychological disorders,\ntherefore, a clear definition of included stressors will aid in developing an\nexplainable and generalizable study design [@ungar2020resilience]. Defining the\nstressors also allow us to measure resilience using a reactivity approach,\nwhere resilience is evaluated as growing tolerance to regular stress\n[@davydov2010resilience]. This way we can partly assess the dynamic process in\ndeveloping an adaptive behavior.\n\nThe presence of stressors disrupts physiological function to a lower utility\nstate [@oken2015systems]. Following the methods proposed by @veer2021psycho,\nour research evaluates two distinct groups of stressor, namely the general\ndaily stressor and health-related stressor. The general stressor is an\ninstrument comprising ten items of daily hassles and life events, while the\nhealth-related stressor consists of items reflecting adversity related to\ngeneral health concern in self, families, and close relatives. Any item rated\nas `\"TRUE\"` is then weighted for the severity, ranging from *not burdensome* (0) to\n*substantially burdensome* (5). Below is the excerpt of the general stressor\nitems:\n\n- Negative political events\n- Conflicts with relatives or colleagues\n- Financial problems\n- Physical health problems\n- Mental health problems\n- Burdensome experiences with family\n- Burdensome experiences in workplace\n- Conflicts with strangers\n- Separation from a loved one, which triggers reduced social contact and\n  loneliness\n- Death of a loved one\n\nThe health-related stressor in @veer2021psycho was particularly narrating\ndistress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In brief, these items are comprised\nof trepidation or perceived burden due to a disease, thus adaptable for a more\ngeneral research context.\n\n## Psychological Outcomes \\label{psych} {#sec-psych}\n\nDepression, anxiety, and burnout are selected as outcomes of interest due to\nthe relatedness between burnout $\\rightleftharpoons$ depression and burnout\n$\\rightleftharpoons$ anxiety [@koutsimani2019relationship]. The partial\ncorrelations have a moderate effect size, signifying the boundary between\nburnout and depression also burnout and anxiety. Therefore, statistically,\neach of depression, anxiety, and burnout does not share similar latent\nconstruct even though they have closely-related manifests. This is\ninterpretable as distinctive remarks to differentiate three of such outcomes\nand the clinical importance of examining the others when one is present.\n\nBurnout is a condition of increasing depersonalization and emotional\nexhaustion, leading to reduced personal accomplishment in the workplace (sense\nof inefficacy). Burnout often happens due to a long-term ongoing stressor,\nwhere the inability to cope with external issues decreases work engagement\n[@Schaufeli2017]. The incidence of burnout overlaps with psychological\ndistress, marked by depressive symptoms or anxiety.\n\nIn a recent finding, burnout is partially explainable by depression and\nanxiety. Depression symptoms pose similar characteristics to exhaustion and\ndepersonalization, while anxiety is related to the sense of personal inefficacy\n[@golonka2019occupational]. In theory, depression is marked by the loss of\nenergy (fatigue) and anxiety is marked by being excessively worried; but a\nstudy suggested the presence of anxious depression [@gaspersz2018patients],\nwhich in turn also implies a pathophysiological overlap between depression and\nanxiety.  Moreover, lower brain connectivity in the default mode network is a\ncurious co-occurrence between depression [@jacob2020neural], anxiety\n[@imperatori2019default], and burnout [@shang2022aberrant]. Neurobiological,\nclinical, and contextual overlaps between depression, anxiety, and burnout\nnecessitate the inclusion of these outcomes to infer a more general impact of\nassociated stressors.\n\nSeveral policies have been implemented to alleviate the mental health burden in\nIndonesia, mainly highlighted in the Mental Health Act in 2014\n[@tampubolon2021covid], and further defined in the Indonesian Minister of\nHealth Regulation Number 77 of 2015 and Indonesian Minister of Health\nRegulation Number 54 of 2017 [@hartono2018tracking]. During the pandemic, the\ngovernment of Indonesia has stipulated a Presidential Decree R1 No. 7 of 2020\nto promptly respond the pandemic; however, the practical implementation has not\naddressed mental health issues. Though, several ongoing initiatives led by the\ngovernment has been realized as a regulation on managing a digital counselling\nplatform [@tampubolon2021covid]. The digital platform, conducted through\nvarious chat-based and video call-based application, helps the general\npopulation to get in touch with therapists, psychologists, counselors, and\neducational practitioners [@ifdil2020online]. Tele-consulting, either through\nchat or video call, enables practitioners to provide psychological first aid to\naddress elevated distress during the pandemic, depression, and anxiety\n[@ifdil2020online].\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"litrev.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
