Resilient individuals have three essential psychological characteristics, including secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions, and having a purpose in life [@rutten2013resilience].  Resilience is a dynamic process regulating the homeostatic plasticity [@vella2019theoretical; @liu2018biological], which reflects a desirable mental control, emotion regulation, coping mechanism, self efficacy, sense of purpose, positive affect, and social support [@precious2019mental]. Resilient individuals are more likely to bounce back from negative events, either by promptly adapting or quickly recovering, to accomplish a more favorable mental health outcome [@ungar2020resilience].\n\nIndividuals with resilient trait have an overall better mental health, indicated by higher life satisfaction and positive affect. Accordingly, the lack of resilient trait also contributes to heightening depression, anxiety, and negative affect [@hu2015meta]. Several studies have also replicated the extensive impact of resilience in lowering depression [@nakazawa2018resilience], anxiety [@ran2020psychological; @schiele2018epigenetics], and burnout [@west2020resilience; @luceno2020symptoms], which shall be the main psychological outcomes highlighted in this study. Intriguingly, burnout has been established as a common association between depression and anxiety [@meier2022meta; @koutsimani2019relationship], suggesting a generic yet distinctive process in relation to mental resilience [@luceno2020symptoms; @serrao2021burnout]. In a situation-specific distress, e.g. the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with higher resilience can adapt better to the abrupt changes, reflected by lower trepidation, reduced anxiety, and attenuated depression [@barzilay2020resilience]. In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused multitude of mental health issues, especially during the large-scale containment which halted the economic activities, mostly impacting those in mid-low socioeconomic stratum, and hindered social activities, resulting in loneliness and in some cases social dejection [@tampubolon2021covid]. The pandemic aggravates the mental health situation in Indonesia, where previously among older adults, 46.28% experienced stress and 31.72% felt depressed [@hanum2022indonesian]. Although the government of Indonesia has implemented The Mental Health act in 2014, the resources and facilities are not widely available [@tampubolon2021covid; @hanum2022indonesian]. Several online mental health services have spurred during the pandemic, but further regulation and mitigation from the government is necessary to abate the spread of mental health problem [@ifdil2020online], i.e. by establishing a government-verified digital counselling platform, multi-stakeholder mental health support program, and improving the accessibility of mental health services in the primary health care[@tampubolon2021covid]. Considering the intricacies between policy-driven action, resilience, situational changes, depression, anxiety, and burnout, the upcoming investigations will be mainly concerned with unravelling the question:\n\n> **\"What is the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various\n> policies to maintain mental resilience amidst adversities, especially\n> regarding their impact on depression, anxiety, and burnout and related\n> medication use?\"**\n\n## Key Issues\n\n## Research Questions\n\n1. What is the role of resilience in the causality of stressors and the\n   anticipated psychological outcomes?\n1. Is there any seasonal pattern on the overtime trend of psychopharmaca uses?\n1. How does the health perception affected by the change of environmental stressors?\n1. What is the impact of institutional-based policy towards individual resilience?\n1. What is the functional state of resilience in a cross-sectional settings?\n\n## Objectives\n\n### General Objectives\n\nThis research aims to delineate the influence of adaptive resilience as a\nbuffer of general health stressors in eliciting depression, anxiety, and\nburnout.\n\n<!-- Comment:\n\nThe general objectives of this research is as a proof of concept regarding the\nuse of a general modelling framework using an agent-based model approach. The\ngeneral modelling framework will take any input in a form of a graph object,\nwhich is rather flexible and extensible. Though the current analytic and\nsimulation capacity is rather narrow, but it shall highlight the importance of\nmodel parameters in a dynamic system, represented as an evolving simulation.\n\n-->\n\n### Specific Objectives\n\nThis research poses five specific objectives, each is focused as a separate\ninvestigation:\n\n1. Systematically find the required modelling parameter through a scoping\n   review\n1. Evaluate the seasonality of psychopharmaca uses\n1. Extract the temporal health parameter by examining the annual mental health\n   profiles\n1. Measure the cost effectiveness of policy interventions affecting individual\n   resilience\n1. Evaluate the output parameters through a large-scale survey\n\n## Appeals\n\nThis research focuses on the data mining process, especially to generate new\ninsight and knowledge (knowledge mining).  The tools used in this research\nshall be free to access under an open-source license, with some restriction to\nthe source code of a more specific use cases, which will be protected under a\nclosed-source license. The highlight of the proposed model is to use\nagent-based model as a general modelling framework using a graph object as its\ninput. The following subsections shall further elaborate how the general\nframework and knowledge mining process can be beneficial for the institution,\nresearchers, and general audiences.\n\n### Appeals to the Institution\n\nFirstly, this research aims to disentangle the general framework of agent-based\nmodelling in a graph object. The general modelling framework will be useful in\nvarious cases representable as a graph object, especially a knowledge graph.\nThis framework is beneficial for the institution, since a patent for specific\nuse cases would be applicable.\n\n### Appeals to the Researchers\n\nSecondly, for researchers, the use of general modelling framework will aid in the\nmodelling workflow. The agent-based model can be treated as a singular building\nblock of an analytic pipeline. This will aid the researchers in generating a\nmore flexible model by incorporating the general modelling framework.\n\n### Appeals to the General Audiences\n\nThirdly, the general audiences will gain benefits from the knowledge mining\nprocess. Generally, this research will highlight effective countermeasures\nagainst psychological stressors and psychological disorders. Furthermore, this\nresearch will yield an insight regarding improving the resilient state.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"intro.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
