{"title":"METHODS","markdown":{"headingText":"METHODS","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis chapter briefly describes the general approach for each proposed\ninvestigation, starting from section [-@sec-scoping.rev] to [-@sec-survey].\nSection [-@sec-scoping.rev] explains the methods on conducting a scoping review\nto understand how resilience is related to mental health. Section [-@sec-med]\nwill describes the approach on understanding the trend of medication uses.\nSection [-@sec-psych.method] elaborates the methods on exploring mental health\nprofiles before and during the pandemic. Section [-@sec-cost] explains the\nmethods on conducting cost-effectiveness analysis. Lastly, section [-@sec-survey]\ndescribes the plan on conducting a mental health survey.\n\n### Data Source {-}\n\nThe data in secondary analyses is requested through Lifelines, IADB, BPJS, and\nPharmlines. IADB and BPJS data are used in section [-@sec-med]. Lifelines data is\nused in section [-@sec-psych.method]. Parameters gained from all data is used in\nsection [-@sec-cost] From the Lifelines data base, we are interested to query the\nquestionnaire data from the baseline assessment 1A, follow-up questionnaire 1B,\nfollow-up questionnaire 1C, second assessment 2A, and follow-up questionnaire\n2B.\n\n## Article 1: Scoping Review on Resilience and Mental Health \\label{scoping.rev} {#sec-scoping.rev}\n\nThe scoping review aims to collect evidences of how resilience acts as a\nmoderator between the causal relationship of stressors and psychological\noutcomes. To conduct the scoping review, we limited the scope of systematic\nsearch as follow:\n\n- **P:** General population aged >18 years old\n- **I:** Stressors as defined in section [-@sec-stressor] *AND* High resilience\n  *AND* Policy intervention\n- **C:** Stressors as defined in section [-@sec-stressor] *AND* Low resilience\n  *AND* Current practices\n- **O:** Depression *OR* Anxiety *OR* Burnout\n\n### Practical Interpretation {-}\n\nEvidence from the scoping review is used to narrate how stressors and\nresilience contributes to psychological disorders, namely depression, anxiety,\nand burnout. Parameters obtained from the scoping review will be used in\nconstructing a mathematical model of cost effectiveness (section [-@sec-cost]).\n\n### Technical Approach {-}\n\nThe systematic search is conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, PsychInfo, and\nCINAHL databases. Filtering is done to include only English-language articles\nand full paper availability. MeSH, Emtree, and thesaurus are used as applicable\nto include all relevant terminologies. Papers older than twenty years are\nexcluded in favor of retaining the conceptual integrity of resilience. As\nexplained by @davydov2010resilience, resilience studies in the past were too\nbroad and inclusive as to not differentiating the trait and state of\nresilience.\n\n## Article 2: Exploring the Trend of Medication Uses \\label{med} {#sec-med}\n\nTo explore the trend of medication, we relied on the IADB and BPJS data\nrepository. The main variable of interest is medication use over the years. In\nthe exploratory analysis, medication use will be described based on its\ntemporal trend then grouped by subjects' demographics. This approach will let\nus investigate which medications are prescribed during a specific time of the\nyear.\n\n### Practical Interpretation {-}\n\nThe main focus of this exploratory analysis is to find the trend and\nseasonality of medication uses to be further analyzed in section [-@sec-cost].\n\n### Technical Approach {-}\n\nPeriodic medication use (medication name grouped in weekly, monthly, quarterly,\nor annual basis) can be represented as a sparse matrix, where both rows and\ncolumns represent medication entity. $N$ number of medications will then form a\nsquare matrix describing the concurrent use of enlisted drugs, therefore, the\nmatrix diagonal represents the use of only one medication over the observation\nperiod.  Medication we would consider are psychiatric medication for `ICD-10`\ncodes `F30`-`F39` (mood disorders) and `F40`-`F48` (anxiety, dissociative,\nstress-related, somatoform, and other non-psychotic mental disorders). The ATC\ncodes for such medications are a part of `N05B` and `N06A`.\n\nThe matrix follows a knowledge graph construct with a subject-predicate-object\n$(s, p, o)$ triples, i.e. `Medication1`-`PrescribedAlongside`-`Medication2`.\nThe graph object is constructed from recorded prescription claim on a daily\nepoch.  The edge (predicate) in this graph represents the number of\nconcurrency, which will be different from one epoch to another depending on the\nnumber of patients claiming the prescription. To leverage this issue, it is\nessential to adjust the weight of the edge by dividing to the number of\npatients ($N$). Adjustment for matrices' elements will regularize all epochs to\nfollow the same scale, as shown in equation [-@eq-adj-mtx1].\n\n$$\n\\stackrel{\\textrm{Unregularized}}{\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  n_{1, 1} & \\dots & n_{1, N} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  n_{N, 1} & \\dots & n_{N, N} \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n}\n\\to\n\\stackrel{\\textrm{Regularized by } N}{\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\frac{n_{1, 1}}{N} & \\dots & \\frac{n_{1, N}}{N} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  \\frac{n_{N, 1}}{N} & \\dots & \\frac{n_{N, N}}{N} \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$ {#eq-adj-mtx1}\n\nOther than the number of patients, we also need to consider regularization\nbased on the defined daily dose [$DDD$, @world2017whocc]. Regularization in equation [-@eq-adj-mtx2]\nwill allow direct comparison of one drug to another when calculating the graph\nmetrics. Regularization based on $DDD$ essentially transforms the dosage into\nunit-free scale, which will be assigned as a weighted edge in the graph object.\n \n$$\n\\stackrel{\\textrm{Unregularized}}{\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  n_{1, 1} & \\dots & n_{1, N} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  n_{N, 1} & \\dots & n_{N, N} \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n}\n\\to\n\\stackrel{\\textrm{Regularized by } DDD}{\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_1}{DDD_1} + \\frac{n_1}{DDD_1} \\right) & \\dots & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_1}{DDD_1} + \\frac{n_N}{DDD_N} \\right) \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_N}{DDD_N} + \\frac{n_1}{DDD_1} \\right) & \\dots & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{n_N}{DDD_N} + \\frac{n_N}{DDD_N} \\right) \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n}\n$$ {#eq-adj-mtx2}\n\nAfter obtaining three matrices, we can find the sum of row from the\nunregularized matrix to calculate the number of individual drug uses in the\npopulation. Meanwhile, regularized matrices are useful when constructing graph\nobjects with different weighting, i.e. one weighted by the number of patients\nand one weighted by the standard dosage recommendation. Graph metrics are\nindividually calculated from both graph objects; per epoch graph metrics are\ntreated as a time-series data, where an epoch equals to daily time point.\n\nTemporal changes of medication uses can be represented as a higher dimension\narray, creating a temporal embedding to the knowledge graph forming a $(s, p,\no, t)$ quadruples [@xu2019temporal; @liu2020context]. As a knowledge graph,\nmatrices in the temporal dimension is subjected to graph measures, which allow\nus to observe the time-serial change of medication uses. Afterwards, sequences\nof graph measures are fitted as a time-series data to model the seasonality by\nperforming a time-series decomposition. This investigation will commence using\nthe data of medication uses in the Northern Netherlands as provided by IADB,\nthen, similar approach will be conducted using the data of medication uses in\nIndonesia as provided by BPJS.\n\n## Article 3: Exploring the Mental Health Profile Before and During the Pandemic \\label{psych.method} {#sec-psych.method}\n\nAll data in this analysis procedure are queried from Lifelines or other\nsuitable databases. Exploratory analysis on mental health profile takes\nmental health indicator as the independent variable, represented as mental\nhealth (stress), sleep, smoking, and social support. Individual traits,\nincluding personality and MMSE, are regarded as moderating variables. The\ndependent variable would be health perception.\n\n### Practical Interpretation {-}\n\nIn this analysis, we are interested in profiling health perception as grouped\nby event-based sequences, i.e. before and during the pandemic. In each group,\npopulation characteristics are described descriptively by evaluating the\nassociation of mental health indicators and health perception.\n\n### Technical Approach {-}\n\nA contingency table is constructed to see the proportional difference of the\ndependent variable based on temporal contingency of before and during the\npandemic. This contingency table is then broken down to evaluate the\nassociation of independent and dependent variables. The relative differences\n(represented as percentages) are extracted and then compared based on the\ntemporal contingency. A generalized linear mixed effect regression is then\nfitted to measure the extent of each independent variable in affecting health\nperception by controlling for individual trait and grouped by the temporal\ncontingency.\n\n## Article 4: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Policy Measures to Increase Resilience \\label{cost} {#sec-cost}\n\nIn the cost-effectiveness analysis, we are interested to see how effective the\ndesignated medication in improving overall well being, health status, and\nhealth perception. The general pre-processing step for independent and\ndependent variables is as described in the section [-@sec-med], where both\nresulting matrices will be further analyzed using a simulation conducted per\nagent-based modelling approach.\n\n### Practical Interpretation {-}\n\nSimulating an agent-based model will return the postulated outcome of event,\naction, and medication defined as a population aggregate from the individual\n(agent) level.  This simulation will help to determine which policies can have\na desirable impact on improving mental resilience.\n\n### Technical Approach {-}\n\nEach individual, institutional, and governmental entity is defined as a\ndifferent type of agent. All agents follow specific rules as indicated by its\nparameters and functions. Parameters used in the model is derived from\nLifelines, IADB, and BPJS data as discussed in section [-@sec-med] and\n[-@sec-psych.method].  Functions in this approach is derived from the findings in\nsection [-@sec-scoping.rev], section [-@sec-med], section [-@sec-psych.method], and\nunpublished work by the author in measuring burnout, depression, and anxiety in\nIndonesia. Agent interaction is defined in a pre-specified digital space and\niterative period with different rate of innervation, e.g. interaction resulting\nfrom the governmental entity has the highest rate of innervation because it\nreach all the other entity. Iterations in this approach is defined as a cycle\nof 24 hours to represent a daily cycle, and will be set to 1,000 iterations\n(daily cycles) by default. Data from Pharmlines and BPJS is analyzed per\nsection [-@sec-med] and used as a ground truth when tweaking the baseline\nparameters to provide a more contextual generalisable model.\n\n## Article 5: Survey on Mental Resilience, Burnout, and Depression \\label{survey} {#sec-survey}\n\nThis survey is a follow up of previous surveys in Indonesia, including\n@elvira2021psychological and @lamuri2023burnout. In this survey, we will employ\na Maslach's Burnout Inventory [MBI, @Maslach1986] to measure burnout; Beck\nDepression Inventory (BDI) to measure depression; and Beck Anxiety Inventory\n(BAI) to measure anxiety; alongside collecting sociodemographic data and\nexposure to stressors as suggested in @sec-stressor.\n\n### Practical Interpretation {-}\n\nThe results from this survey imply the state of being resilient as a moderator\nof stressor and psychological disorders. Conducting the survey will allow us to\npropose a streamlined and generalisable approach to measure the effectiveness\nof suggested policy.\n\n### Technical Approach {-}\n\nThe required sample for a survey is estimable following various methods. As proposed by @cochran1977sampling, two factors play an important role in determining the sample size, namely the alpha level and the acceptable level or error. @kotrlik2001organizational summarized several ways of calculating the required sample size, where equation [-@sec-eq-sample1] and [-@sec-eq-sample2] excerpted the calculation for continuous variable.\n\n\\begin{align}\nn_0 &= \\frac{t^2 \\cdot s^2}{d^2} \\label{eq-sample1} \\\\\nn   &= \\frac{n_0}{1 + \\frac{n_0}{N}} \\label{eq-sample2}\n\\end{align}\n\nDenoted in Equation [-@sec-eq-sample1], $n$ is the estimated minimum number of samples; $t$ is the value acquired from T distribution, where $t$ = 1.96 when $\\alpha$ = 0.05; $s$ is the estimated standard deviation of responses in the population; $d$ is the acceptable margin of error mean estimation. Computing $s$ requires dividing the number of inclusive scale in a questionnaire response by 6, the total number of deviation in a normal distribution. In case we are using a 7-point scale, the value of $s$ would be $\\frac{7}{6}$ = 1.167. Lastly, the acceptable margin of error for mean estimation $d$ is the product of points on scale and the acceptable margin of error, conveniently set as 7 $\\cdot$ 0.3 = 0.21.  Equation [-@sec-eq-sample2] is rather straightforward, where the newly introduced variable is $N$ = 10,562,088, representing the total number of population in Jakarta. Plugging in all the numbers into equation resulted in Equation [-@sec-eq-sample3], where the minimum number of samples should be 119.\n\n\\begin{align}\nn_0 &= \\frac{1.96^2 \\cdot 1.167^2}{0.21^2} \\label{eq-sample3} \\\\\n    &= 118.64 \\notag \\\\\n    &\\approx 119 \\notag \\\\\nn   &= \\frac{119}{1 + \\frac{119}{10,562,088}} \\notag \\\\\n    &= 118.99 \\notag \\\\\n    &\\approx 119 \\notag\n\\end{align}\n\nOn the other hand, sample size calculation can also be done by inverting the power calculation of a binomial distribution, as presented in [-@sec-eq-sample4]. In this equation, $p$ represents the proportion of event; $z$ is a Z distribution corresponding to the $\\alpha$ value; $E$ is the expected maximum error, which is conveniently agreed as 3%. Following this formula, it is possible to integrate disease prevalence as a proportion $p$ when calculating the required sample size. According to @GBD2022, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in 2019 was 3,440 and 3,779 per 100,000 people, respectively. Thus, the proportion for depression $p_D$ and anxiety $p_A$ are 0.034 and 0.038. By choosing the highest proportion, we can estimate the required sample size as indicated in Equation [-@sec-eq-sample5].\n\n\\begin{align}\nn &= \\frac{p \\cdot (1 - p) \\cdot z^2}{E^2} \\label{eq-sample4} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{0.038 \\cdot (1 - 0.038) \\cdot 1.96^2}{0.03^2} \\label{eq-sample5} \\\\\n  &\\approx 156 \\notag\n\\end{align}\n\nHaving two sample size estimations, i.e. 119 and 156, we tend to choose the higher number of minimum sample. The survey will use a stratified, clustered random sampling. Initially, a pilot study according to @Cohen2013 will be commenced to acquire 156 individuals representing the general population. Then, the required sample size is recalculated with Monte-Carlo simulation using the pilot data [@Green2016]. All stressors as indicated in section [-@sec-stressor] will be grouped based on its type (general and health-related), then a PCA will be fitted and the first principal component will be extracted. Similarly, the sum of items from each psychological outcomes will be fitted into a PCA model and its first principal component will be extracted. Then, a linear regression model will be fitted to measure the association between the first principal component from stressors and the first principal component from psychological outcomes.  Resilience is defined as the regularized inverted residuals from the linear regression. Further exploratory analysis is then conducted to profile the resilience in all participants. From this profile, we can further infer which variables promote a good resilience.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"methods.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
